This is a simple Qt/C++ project explained in detail in the blog post: [How to embed a database in your application with SQLite and Qt](http://blog.davidecoppola.com/2016/11/howto-embed-database-in-application-with-sqlite-and-qt/).

It shows how to use SQLite and Qt SQL to add a relational database to an application.

You can also find a QML version [here](https://github.com/tanius/qml-sql-example) made by [tanius](https://github.com/tanius).
